      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",

       "The answer is simple and easy to understand if we recognize the underlying structure.\n",
       "\n",
       "Let's break down the reasoning into simple steps:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Understand the constraints:**\n",
       "    *   We have 7 friends.\n",
       "    *   On each of 7 nights, we invite a group of 3 friends.\n",
       "    *   The group of 3 friends invited on any given night must be different from the groups invited on other nights.\n",
       "    *   Crucially, any pair of friends can be together for at most one dinner.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Analyze the \"pair\" constraint:**\n",
       "    *   Consider any two friends, say Alice and Bob. They can only be invited together on at most one of the seven nights.\n",
       "    *   How many possible pairs of friends are there? With 7 friends, the number of pairs is $\\binom{7}{2} = \\frac{7 \\times 6}{2} = 21$.\n",
       "    *   On any given night, when we invite 3 friends, how many pairs are formed? If the friends are A, B, and C, the pairs are (A, B), (A, C), and (B, C). This is $\\binom{3}{2} = 3$ pairs.\n",
       "    *   Since we have 7 nights, and each night forms 3 pairs, and each pair can appear at most once, the total number of unique pairs formed across all 7 nights is at most $7 \\times 3 = 21$.\n",
       "    *   Since the total number of possible pairs is exactly 21, the condition \"at most one dinner\" implies that *every possible pair of friends must be together on exactly one dinner*.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Identify the structure:**\n",
       "    *   We are looking for a collection of 7 groups (dinners), each containing 3 friends, chosen from a set of 7 friends, such that every possible pair of friends appears in exactly one of these groups.\n",
       "    *   This is a well-known mathematical structure called a Steiner triple system $S(2, 3, 7)$. It is also known as the Fano plane.\n",
       "    *   It turns out there is only *one* such collection of 7 groups of 3 friends that satisfies this property. Let's call these 7 specific groups $G_1, G_2, G_3, G_4, G_5, G_6, G_7$.\n",
       "\n",
       "4.  **Consider the \"successive nights\" aspect:**\n",
       "    *   The problem states \"seven successive nights.\" This means the order in which these 7 groups are invited matters.\n",
       "    *   For example, inviting group $G_1$ on Monday and $G_2$ on Tuesday is different from inviting $G_2$ on Monday and $G_1$ on Tuesday.\n",
       "    *   We have 7 distinct groups ($G_1$ to $G_7$) that need to be assigned to the 7 distinct nights (Night 1 to Night 7).\n",
       "\n",
       "5.  **Calculate the number of ways:**\n",
       "    *   For the first night, we can choose any of the 7 unique groups.\n",
       "    *   For the second night, we can choose any of the remaining 6 unique groups.\n",
       "    *   For the third night, we can choose any of the remaining 5 unique groups.\n",
       "    *   ...and so on, until the seventh night, where there is only 1 group left to choose.\n",
       "    *   The total number of ways is the product of the number of choices for each night: $7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1$.\n",
       "    *   This is the definition of 7 factorial, denoted as $7!$.\n",
       "\n",
       "6.  **Compute the final answer:**\n",
       "    *   $7! = 5040$.\n",
       "\n",
       "Therefore, there are 5040 ways to invite the friends according to the given conditions.\n",
       "\n",
       "The simplicity comes from the fact that the set of 7 groups is uniquely determined by the constraints. The problem then reduces to arranging these 7 unique groups over the 7 nights.\n",
       "\n",
       "Final check of the question wording: \"a different subset of three of these friends\". This confirms that the sets must be distinct. \"seven successive nights\" confirms order matters. \"each pair of friends are together for at most one dinner\" is the key constraint that leads to the unique set of 7 triples.\n",
       "\n",
       "The answer is indeed $7!$.\n",
       "\n",
       "The final answer is $\\boxed{5040}$."

       "\n",
       "1.  **Possible Pairs:** First, let's figure out how many unique pairs of friends can be formed from the 7 friends. We can use combinations for this:\n",
       "\n",
       "    *   The number of ways to choose 2 friends out of 7 is given by the combination formula: 7C2 = 7! / (2! * 5!) = (7 * 6) / (2 * 1) = 21.  There are 21 possible pairs of friends.\n",

       "\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

    "LLM embeddings are dense numerical vectors that represent the semantic meaning of text. Generated by Large Language Models, they map words, phrases, or documents into a high-dimensional space where similar concepts are positioned closely together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their key advantages are:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Contextual Understanding:** Unlike older methods, LLM embeddings are contextual. The vector for a word like **\"bank\"** will be different depending on whether it's used in the context of a \"river bank\" or a \"money bank,\" providing a more nuanced representation of language.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Versatility from Pre-training:** They are pre-trained on vast amounts of text data. This allows them to generalize effectively across various tasks, such as classification, clustering, and similarity detection. They do not require extensive retraining.\n",

    "We can see that even with Gemini's embeddings there doesn't seem to be a clear 2D separation of clusters with our data classes. It could be because emotions are often not discrete. Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

Expert forecasts suggest a substantial loss of entry-level white-collar jobs, with clerical, administrative, and customer service roles being most vulnerable. This automation can lead to societal and political risks, including increased inequality, undermined social stability, and heightened public anxiety. A specific ethical concern is the loss of junior positions, which hinders long-term workforce development and mentorship.\n",

AI models may reproduce copyrighted material without proper acknowledgment, as their training data often includes copyrighted content scraped from the internet. This can lead to copyright infringement when the AI reuses elements in its generated content. For researchers, this raises ethical concerns about academic integrity, while businesses face legal risks if AI-generated outputs are too similar to existing copyrighted materials."

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
