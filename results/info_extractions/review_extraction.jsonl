animated tale of species\ncoexistence – until a stray comment from the bunny-cop heroine turns\nthe whole place into a hate-filled Trump rally\nJordan Hoffman\nThu 3 Mar 2016 15.32 GMT\nAn anthropomorphized hippopotamus in a business suit will always be welcome. To that end, Disney’s Zootopia (Zootropolis in\nthe UK, but Zoomania in Germany – make of these permutations what you will) has solid protection from criticism baked in.\nFrom enormous elephants to zippy voles, all creatures great and small are dressed in funny outfits and, thanks to some very\nexpensive computers, doing adorable things. A stoner yak voiced by Tommy Chong? It takes a concentrated effort to not at least\nchuckle. Luckily there’s just enough of a story here to keep the over-eight set engaged once the novelty wears off.\nThe world of Zootopia is one with no humans. All animals live together in basic tolerance. Predators have had the savagery bred\nout of them, so a lion can be near a sheep and everyone is chill. This isn’t to say there isn’t residual prejudice. “Just because he\nhappened to be a fox” is a phrase a young Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) reminds her provincial bunny parents when they bring\nup a touchy moment from her childhood.\n2025/11/18 晚上9:05\nZootopia review – Disney's furry fable gets its claws out for the bigots | Zootopia (aka Zootropolis) | The Guardian\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/zootopia-zootropolis-zoomania-review-disney\n1/4\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\nWatch a trailer for Zootopia\nJudy is an idealist and, thanks to the mayor’s Mammal Inclusion Initiative, the first bunny to graduate from the police academy.\nSoon she’s zooming away from the farmlands to the gleaming city of Zootopia, where “anyone can be anything”, but she still\nneeds to remind a well-meaning but microaggresive cheetah that “only a bunny can call another bunny cute”.\nThe city itself is the best part of the picture, a gorgeous melange of design elements. Its center has a touch of Futurama, but\nthere’s also Sahara Square, Tundratown, the Rainforest District and Little Rodentia. That last bit is especially funny, because\nwhen even tiny Judy Hopps is racing through it she looks like Godzilla stomping on Tokyo.\nJudy’s zealous nature gets her in trouble with the police chief (Idris Elba, voicing a giant water buffalo), but he shouldn’t be\nselling her short and sticking her with meter-maid duty. Naturally she’s the one that’s going to crack the case of the 14 missing\nmammals.\nMayor Lionheart (JK Simmons) and Assistant Mayor Bellwether (Jenny Slate). Photograph: Disney/AP\nShe doesn’t do it alone, though. She ensnares Nick Wilde, a conniving sly fox (voiced by Jason Bateman) to help her, and when\nthey work together and overcome their bigotry, there are life lessons blazing off the screen. But here’s where Zootopia gets a little\ninteresting. There’s a natural endpoint to the story when the bad guy gets captured, but there’s a twist. I wouldn’t normally get\ninto such late-in-the-game story details, but there’s really not much else meriting discussion beyond hissing at the painfully\nZootopia Official US Trailer #2\nZootopia Official US Trailer #2\n2025/11/18 晚上9:05\nZootopia review – Disney's furry fable gets its claws out for the bigots | Zootopia (aka Zootropolis) | The Guardian\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/zootopia-zootropolis-zoomania-review-disney\n2/4\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 3**\n\"\"\"\nFirst look review\n\n\nIs This Thing On? review –\nBradley Cooper’s comedy\nof comedians is a charmer\n11 Oct 2025\nCover-Up review – Laura\nPoitras’s Seymour Hersh\ndocumentary is a thrilling\node to journalism\n9 Oct 2025\nSpringsteen: Deliver Me\nfrom Nowhere review –\nsolid biopic both embraces\nand avoids cliche\n30 Sept 2025\nAnemone review – Daniel\nDay-Lewis returns for a\nbleak and painfully serious\nmisfire\n29 Sept 2025\nEternity rev\ncharming af\nconcept love\ncomedy\n12 Sept 2025\nMore from Culture\nFilm\n‘So weird, but cute’: Bridget\nJones immortalised as\nTicketing\nReselling tickets for profit\nto be outlawed in UK\nFilm\n‘I was born in a melting pot.\nMelting isn’t fun’: Jon M\nTV\nDavid Nicholls to adapt The\nSecret Diary of Adrian Mole\nHow we made\n‘People still b\ntheir perfora\ndrawn-out parody of The Godfather, or applauding the we’re-going-to-annoy-you humor at the sloth-run Department of Mammal\nVehicles.\nThe missing mammals are being held because for some reason they have reverted to their savage states, and have committed\nunpredictable (PG-rated) atrocities.

Photograph: Disney/AP\nWoe be to anyone who tries to argue a one-to-one comparison between the predators v prey theme and any real-life controversy.\nIt flashes on everything from typical rightwing radio cliches to general false-flag paranoia. It’s somewhat heavy material for a film\naimed at children, but perhaps very necessary in an age where a beer-stained uncle might have ruined Thanksgiving wearing a\nMake America Great Again baseball cap.\nIt’s still Disney, though, and it concludes happily and without much nuance. There’s ample space given for prey like Judy to\napologize to unjustly accused predators (like her fox buddy), and for everyone to grow. It’s a good message, and one that will no\ndoubt infuriate the right, who will say that Disney spent however many millions producing propaganda in favor of, for instance,\nthe Iran deal – to pull one of a hundred different interpretations out of my ear. That this cute picture with funny giraffes and\ngazelles will be manipulated to further fuel hate is just all the more evidence that we haven’t yet fully evolved beyond our savage\nanimal state.\n Zootopia is released in the US on 4 March and as Zootropolis in the UK on 25 March.\n2025/11/18 晚上9:05\nZootopia review – Disney's furry fable gets its claws out for the bigots | Zootopia (aka Zootropolis) | The Guardian\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/03/zootopia-zootropolis-zoomania-review-disney\n3/4\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 4**\n\"\"\"\nLondon welcomes statue of\nBritain’s favourite\nsingleton\n19h ago\ngovernment crackdown\n19h ago\nChu on Wicked: For Good,\nAriana Grande – and living\nthe American dream\n20h ago\nAged 13¾ for BBC\n19h ago\nhow we mad\nads\n22h ago\nView more comments\nComments (45)\nThis discussion is now closed for comments but you can still sign in or create your Guardian account to join the discussion next time\n1\n2\nDisplaying threads 1 to 25 of 26\n31 Mar 2016 16.48\n4\nI have just seen this film and was so impressed that I had to write about it.
