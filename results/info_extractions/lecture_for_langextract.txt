# LECTURE ANALYSIS: Interactive Participation and Lottery System
## Video Segment: 02:59-04:59

[SLIDE DESCRIPTION]
A slide displays 'slido' at the top, a QR code, and the text 'Join at slido.com #5216 897'.

[TRANSCRIPT - 03:01-04:07]
And then here's the QR code on the whiteboard. Scan it and mark that URL. It will be used later. Right now it will say 'did not accept' when we try to open a lottery participation time. Right now it will say 'did not accept any response' because we haven't opened it. We will open it for the time when I say it is the time. So then get this QR code now. Here I am not going to relieve this QR code during the time. We will see the QR code lottery time for three times, I think for today's session. And when a lottery starts, you guys would go for this class lottery QR code first and then if still have the time, you can go to the online lottery so you can participate twice. And in the end of the session, our TA will come here and to play the lottery game. Yay.

So if your classmate just come, did not hear, please let them know, okay? Do this QR code first.

[TRANSCRIPT - 04:47-04:58]
This is the slide. It's not a lottery. This is for Q&A or some other question during the class.
