Zootopia review – Disney&#x27;s furry fable gets its claws out for the bigots
Predators and prey learn to get along in this animated tale of species
coexistence – until a stray comment from the bunny-cop heroine turns
the whole place into a hate-filled Trump rally
Jordan Hoffman
Thu 3 Mar 2016 15.32 GMT
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">An anthropomorphized hippopotamus in a business suit will always be welcome.</span> To that end, Disney’s Zootopia (Zootropolis in
the UK, but Zoomania in Germany – make of these permutations what you will) has solid protection from criticism baked in.
From enormous elephants to zippy voles, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">all creatures great and small are dressed in funny outfits and, thanks to some very
expensive computers, doing adorable things.</span> <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">A stoner yak voiced by Tommy Chong? <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">It takes a concentrated effort to not at least
chuckle.</span></span> Luckily <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there’s just enough of a story here <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">to keep the over-eight set engaged once the novelty wears off.</span></span>
The world of Zootopia is one with no humans. All animals live together in basic tolerance. Predators have had the savagery bred
out of them, so a lion can be near a sheep and everyone is chill. This isn’t to say there isn’t residual prejudice. “Just because he
happened to be a fox” is a phrase a young Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) reminds her provincial bunny parents when they bring
up a touchy moment from her childhood.

Watch a trailer for Zootopia
Judy is an idealist and, thanks to the mayor’s Mammal Inclusion Initiative, the first bunny to graduate from the police academy.
Soon she’s zooming away from the farmlands to the gleaming city of Zootopia, where “anyone can be anything”, but she still
needs to remind a well-meaning but microaggresive cheetah that “only a bunny can call another bunny cute”.
The city itself is the best part of the picture, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a gorgeous melange of design elements</span>. Its center has a touch of Futurama, but
there’s also Sahara Square, Tundratown, the Rainforest District and Little Rodentia. That last bit is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">especially funny</span>, because
when even tiny Judy Hopps is racing through it she looks like Godzilla stomping on Tokyo.
Judy’s zealous nature gets her in trouble with the police chief (Idris Elba, voicing a giant water buffalo), but he <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">shouldn’t be
selling her short</span> and sticking her with meter-maid duty. Naturally she’s the one that’s going to crack the case of the 14 missing
mammals.

She doesn’t do it alone, though. She ensnares Nick Wilde, a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">conniving sly fox</span> (voiced by Jason Bateman) to help her, and when
they work together and overcome their bigotry, there are <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">life lessons blazing off the screen</span>. But here’s where Zootopia gets a little
interesting. There’s a natural endpoint to the story when the bad guy gets captured, but there’s a twist. I wouldn’t normally get
into such late-in-the-game story details, but there’s really not much else meriting discussion beyond hissing at the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">painfully</span>

Vehicles.
The missing mammals are being held because for some reason they have reverted to their savage states, and have committed
unpredictable (PG-rated) atrocities. Judy says some <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">problematic things</span> during a press conference and, within moments, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the bliss
of Zootopia’s utopia is shattered</span>. Soon society devolves into an enormous Trump rally, with an <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">unhelpful press corps</span> fanning the
flames of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">xenophobia and ignorance</span>.

Woe be to anyone who tries to argue a one-to-one comparison between the predators v prey theme and any real-life controversy.
It flashes on everything from typical rightwing radio cliches to general false-flag paranoia. It’s somewhat <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">heavy material for a film
aimed at children</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">perhaps very necessary</span> in an age where a beer-stained uncle might have ruined Thanksgiving wearing a
Make America Great Again baseball cap.
It’s still Disney, though, and it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">concludes happily and without much nuance</span>. There’s ample space given for prey like Judy to
apologize to unjustly accused predators (like her fox buddy), and for everyone to grow. It’s a good message, and one that will no
doubt infuriate the right, who will say that Disney spent however many millions producing propaganda in favor of, for instance,
the Iran deal – to pull one of a hundred different interpretations out of my ear. That this cute picture with funny giraffes and
gazelles will be manipulated to further fuel hate is just all the more evidence that we haven’t yet fully evolved beyond our savage
animal state.
 Zootopia is released in the US on 4 March and as Zootropolis in the UK on 25 March.

I have just seen this film and was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">so impressed</span> that I had to write about it. The following contains spoilers!
First off, I am <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">surprised how so many reviewers seem to be wilfully blind to its central message</span>: that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we all, both male and female, have our own
strengths and weaknesses</span>, that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">divisive and hate-filled &#x27;us and them&#x27; gender politics solve nothing</span> and instead we must recognise that <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">we need
and compliment each other and should appreciate each other for what we are</span>
